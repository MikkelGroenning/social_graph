        <p>
          This page is devoted to give a brief overview of our results from our analysis based on data of tweets from American Politicans. 
          If you haven't all ready famlized yourself with the data we urge check out the <a href="data.html">data</a> page prior to reading this page. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As this page only contains a subsets of the findings, the full analysis as well code that can re-produce the results can be seen in the <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MikkelGroenning/social_graph/blob/main/Notebooks/Explainer_Notebook.ipynb">Explainer-Notebook</a>.
          Feel free to checkout our <a href=https://github.com/MikkelGroenning/social_graph >Github reposortory</a> as well.

        <h2 class="mt-5">Basic Statistics</h2>
        <p>
          This section will briefily summerize the data used prior to any graph modelling. 
          The section is composed of two parts. The first part will describe the number of polictians in the dataset and their assocaitions to parties as well as their assocaition to the state which they were elected from. 
          The second section will briefily eloborate how the polictians use Twitter. That is the number of tweets they post and difference between amount of tweets per party.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-5">Statitics of Polticians</h3>
        <p>Below is party distribution plotted for the polticians in the data.</p>
        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
          <iframe src="plotly_files/tweet_barplot_parties.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe> 
        </div>
        <p>Here is American the two-party system is clearly seen - though there is room for two independents, Bernie Sanders and Angus King as well as one Libertarian Justin Amash.</p>
        <p>Another interesting aggregation is based on the type (i.e. Representative, Senator, or President (POTUS)). Below are the numbers aggregated together with the party so the distribution can be shown.</p>
        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
          <iframe src="plotly_files/tweet_parties_2_barplot.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe> 
        </div>
        <p>
          Immediatly it becomes clear that representitatives clearly dominates the dataset with a total of 503 Representatives 244 repulicans and 259 Democrats.
          Senators are only 111 while there naturally only is one President, Donald J. Trump. 
          Between the 115th and 116th congress all 435 seats in the house of representitatives were up for election while only around a third of the 100 seats in the Senate were up for election. 
          That means some where not re-elected and thus replaced by another candiate but they still appear in the dataset.
          Moreover United States overseas territories also gets seats in the house of representitatives (though without voting power). With these reasons it makes sense that representitatives are so dominant.
          Furthermore it explains why the total number of Senetors and Representives excessed 435 and 100 respectivly, which is number of seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate respectivly.
          From the plot the stacked element also clearly illustrates two party system - Democrats and Repuliblicans domminate the political landscape but are fairly equal in terms of sizes.
        </p>
        <p>Another interesting feature is the state representatation. Below are a stacked barplot shown for every state in the dataset describing the representation for every party.
           There is a total 56 states. This is more than the 50 usual states that we hear about. 
           This is because American Samoa, District of Columbia, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands also gets seats in the House of Representiatives.
           They do not have voting power but they can participate in debates. These are marked with (*).

        <h3 class="mt-5">Statistics of Tweets from Politicans</h3>
        <p>In this part the basic statistics of the exstracted tweets from the politicians will be presented.</p>
        <p>Let's first look at the number of tweets based on the party and type states in the dataset.</p>
        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
          <iframe src="plotly_files/tweet_barplot.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe> 
        </div>
        <p>
          From the barplot, it can be seen that Democrats tweet much more than the Republicans colleges despite their proportion of profile is close to equal. Interesting is also seen that Senators tweet disproportionally more than their colleagues in the House of Representatives - particularly for the Republicans. Recall the 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> 244 Republican Representatives</li>
          <li> 259 Democratic Representatives</li>
          <li> 60 Republican Senators</li>
          <li> 51 Democratic Senators</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lets explore the distribution of number of tweets posted per politician. </p>
        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
          <iframe src="plotly_files/tweet_distribution.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe> 
        </div>
        <p>From the stacked historgram a skewed distribution is seen. Most politicans have tweeted less than 5000 times, but a few are super active on the platform. </p>
        <h2 class="mt-5">Follow Graph Analysis</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          In this section result from the follow graph will be presented. 
          The follow graph is constructed based on which profiles that follow eachother on Twitter.
          In other words if e.g. a Senator follows anoter Senator on Twitter a directed edge between them is constructed.
          The idea is illustrated in the image below. 
          In this graph we consider the three politicans <i>Dean Heller</i>, <i>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</i> and <i>Bernie Sanders</i> as nodes. 
          There is directed edge between <i>Dean Heller</i> and <i>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</i> that means that <i>Dean Heller</i> follows <i>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</i> on Twitter.
          As <i>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</i> does not follow <i>Dean Heller</i> there is not edge going the opposite direction. 
          Following the annology it can be seen that <i>Bernie Sanders</i> follow <i>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</i> and vice wheras <i>Dean Heller</i> follow <i>Bernie Sander</i> but <i>Bernie Sanders</i> does not follow <i>Dean Heller</i>. 
          This is the type of graph that will be created for all 618 politicans in our dataset.
        </p>

        <p>
          Below can the full follow graph for be seen. However, note that edges have only been drawn if there is a link going in both direction between a node. 
          Furthermore only <i>Giant Connected Component</i> are displayed.

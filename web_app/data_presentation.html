        <p>
          This page is devoted to give a brief overview of our results from our analysis based on data of tweets from American Politicans. 
          If you haven't already familized yourself with the data we urge you to check out the <a href="data.html">data</a> page prior to reading this page to know what data is used. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As this page only contains a subsets of the findings, the full analysis as well as the code for reproducing the results, can be found in <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MikkelGroenning/social_graph/blob/main/Notebooks/Explainer_Notebook.ipynb">Explainer-Notebook</a>.
          Feel free to checkout our <a href=https://github.com/MikkelGroenning/social_graph >Github repository</a> as well.

        <h2 class="mt-5">Basic Statistics</h2>
        <p>
          This section will briefly summarize the data used for all graph modelling and is composed by two parts. The first part desribes the number of politicians in the dataset and their associations to parties as well as their association to the state which they were elected from. 
          The second part briefly eloborates on how the politicians use Twitter, i.e. how many tweets each politician has made and the difference between the amount of tweets based on party.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-5">Statistics of Politicians</h3>
        <p>Below, the party distribution plotted for the politicians in the data can be seen.</p>
        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
          <iframe src="plotly_files/tweet_barplot_parties.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe> 
        </div>
        <p>The political system in America containing only two parties is clearly illustrated as well as two independents, Bernie Sanders and Angus King. One Libertarian, Justin Amash, is also present.</p>
        <p>Another interesting aggregation is based on the types in the congress, i.e. Representative, Senator, or President (POTUS). Below are the numbers aggregated together with the party such that the distribution can be visualized.</p>
        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
          <iframe src="plotly_files/tweet_parties_2_barplot.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe> 
        </div>
        <p>
          Immediately, it becomes clear that the representatives dominate the dataset with a total of 503 people, hereby 244 are Repulicans and 259 are Democrats.
          There are only 111 senator and naturally onle one president - Donald J. Trump.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between the 115th and 116th congress all 435 seats in the house of representatives were up for election while only around a third of the 100 seats in the Senate were up for election. 
          That means some of them were not reelected and thus replaced by another candiate, still they are presented in the dataset.
          Moreover, the United States overseas territories also get seats in the house of representatives (but without voting power). With these reasons it makes sense that the representatives are so dominant.
          Furthermore, it explains why the total number of senators and representatives exceeds 435 and 100, which is number of seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate respectively.
          From the plot the stacked elements also illustrates the two party system - Democrats and Republicans domminate the political landscape but are fairly equal in terms of sizes.
        </p>
        <p>Another interesting feature is the representation of the states. Below can be seen a stacked barplot for every state in the dataset describing the representation for every party.
           There is a total 56 states which is more than the usual 50 states that we hear about. 
           This is because American Samoa, District of Columbia, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands also get seats in the House of Representatives.
           They do not have the power to vote but they can participate in debates. These are marked with (*).
        </p>
        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
          <iframe src="plotly_files/tweet_parties_3_barplot.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe> 
        </div>
        
        <h3 class="mt-5">Statistics of Tweets from Politicans</h3>
        <p>In this part the basic statistics of the extracted tweets from the politicians will be presented.</p>
        <p>Let's first have a look at the number of tweets based on the party and the type stated in the dataset.</p>
        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
          <iframe src="plotly_files/tweet_barplot.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe> 
        </div>
        <p>
          From the barplot, it can be seen that Democrats tweet much more than the Republicans despite their proportion of profile is close to being equal. It is also tnteresting to see that Senators tweet disproportionally more than their colleagues in the House of Representatives - particularly for the Republicans. Recall that there are
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> 244 Republican Representatives,</li>
          <li> 259 Democratic Representatives,</li>
          <li> 60 Republican Senators, and</li>
          <li> 51 Democratic Senators</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let's explore the distribution of the number of tweets posted per politician. </p>
        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
          <iframe src="plotly_files/tweet_distribution.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe> 
        </div>
        <p>From the stacked historgram a skewed distribution is seen. Most politicans have tweeted less than 5000 times, but a few are super active on the platform. </p>

        <p>
          The presidency of Donald J. Trump began at noon EST (17:00 UTC) on January 20, 2017 when he was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, and will come to an end the on January 20, 2021 as he ultimately lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden.
          It is not far fetched to say it has been bizzare precidency compared to the most recent precidencies. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It feels like America has been splitted in two; the supporters of Trump and those against him - Repulicans against Democrats. In this project we wanted to explore if our hypothesis whether the political polarization is clearly expressed or not by analyzing the behaviour of the Congress of United States on the social media Twitter including the infamous Twitter account managed by Donald J. Trump. The idea was to analyze the congress tweets from the time of the 45th precidency to explore potential polarization. Additionally, twitter accounts for 16 of the major media in the US have been investigated, as these might also have an impact on the polarization.

        The idea was to analyze tweets from the congress from the period of the 45th precidency and analyze the possible influence from the media to explore potential political polarization. We have made a short video as a small appetizer that describes our approaches throughout this project:

        The weibsite is structured such that we have a tab where data used in the project is explained. Here you can also find a link to how you can recreate all the results yourself.

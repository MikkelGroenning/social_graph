        <p>
          The presidency of Donald J. Trump began at noon EST (17:00 UTC) on January 20, 2017 when he was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, and will come to an end the on January 20, 2021 as he ultimately lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden.
          It is not far fetched to say it has been bizzare precidency compared to the most recent precidencies. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It feels like America has been splitted in two; the supporters of Trump and those against him - Repulicans against Democrats. In this project we wanted to explore if our hypothesis whether the political polarization is clearly expressed or not by analyzing the behaviour of the Congress of United States on the social media Twitter including the infamous Twitter account managed by Donald J. Trump. The idea was to analyze the congress tweets from the time of the 45th precidency to explore potential polarization. Additionally, twitter accounts for 16 of the major media in the US have been investigated, as these might also have an impact on the polarization.
        </p>
      
        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
          <img src="figures/congress.png" width=350 height=250 /> <img src="figures/trumpeten.png" width=350 height=250 /> <img src="figures/medias.jpg" width=350 height=250 /> > 
        </div>
        <p>
          The idea was to analyze tweets from the congress from the period of the 45th precidency and analyze the possible influence from the media to explore potential political polarization. 
          Prior to creating the project we had to make a small video with our idea for the project. 
          We still think it works as appetizer that describes our approaches throughout this project - check it out below
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-5"> A Small Introduction to The Structure of The Website </h3>
        <p>
          The weibsite consist of 7 tab or pages that can be seen below or be found in navigation bar on the top of the page. 
          The idea is to go trough the tabs/pages one by one in chronological order.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> <a class="link" href="index.html">Home</a> </li>
          <li> <a class="link" href="data.html">Data</a> </li>
          <li> <a class="link" href="data_presentation.html">Basic Statistics</a> </li>
          <li> <a class="link" href="follow_graph.html">Follow Graph</a> </li>
          <li> <a class="link" href="text_analysis.html">Text Analysis</a> </li>
          <li> <a class="link" href="retweets.html">Analysis of Retweets</a> </li>
          <li> <a class="link" href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MikkelGroenning/social_graph/blob/main/Notebooks/Explainer_Notebook.ipynb">Explainer Notebook</a> </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By going through the tab one by one the data source and the data will first be presented. 
          Afterward follows three different analyses of tweets. 
        <p>
          In the first analysis <a class="link" href="follow_graph.html">Follow Graph</a> we will examine how the polticians follow eachother on Twitter and construct a graph to resemple that.
          It will be discovered how the Senators differ from Representatives, Republicans from Democrats and how states clusters together in finding communities across the graph
        </p>
        <p>
          In the second analysis <a class="link" href="text_analysis.html">Text Analysis</a> the text, which tweets consist of, will be analyzed with natural language processing techniques to extract quantities measures in how communities extracted in the prior analysis differ in their choices of words.
          It will be discovered how the politicians differ on a state level. And it will be shown how interesting terms/topics occur/disappears during the span of time available in a Lexical Dispersion plot. 
          Finally, it will be discovered how "nice" politicians talk to each other across parties and type (Representatives or Senators) using sentiment analysis. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In the last analysis <a class="link" href="retweets.html">Analysis of Retweets</a> we will look into how the polticians retweet eachother and the media.
          Here we will assume that if a politician (or someone in general) retweets a tweet from a different account because they like the content that the other user made.
          A graph is constructed based on retweets of the politicians internally and the degree distribution examined and it revealed how the politicians retweet each other across and inside parties.
          Furthermore, a bipartite graph is constructed between the politicians and the media in order to see which politicians and most found of which media. 
          Here the degree distribution is examined with a bipariatie perspective. 
        </p>

          All the results can be re-construced by opening the <a class="link" href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MikkelGroenning/social_graph/blob/main/Notebooks/Explainer_Notebook.ipynb">Explainer Notebook</a>.
          On every analysis page, there will be a direct link to how the work can be recreated as well.
          This explains the results more in-depth as well as provide code on how the results were recreated. 
          The entire code base is publicly available at our <a class="link" href="https://github.com/MikkelGroenning/02805_social_graphs">Github Repository </a>.

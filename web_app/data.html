        <h1 class="mt-5">Data Used for Performing The Analysis</h1>
        <p>
            This page describes how the data to perform the analysis has been extracted. In order to easily download tweets, a Twitter Developer account is needed. Access to such an account can be applied for at <a href='https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access'> Apply for access</a>. With this account, the Twitter API can be utilized.
            The Twitter API only get one access to to exctract the most reason 3200 tweets from a given account (3200 tweet do not go far back for many american polticians). However, Twitter's Terms of Service do allow for datasets of tweets ID's to be distributed to third parties (not the full JSON). Tweets dating back can be extracted if one has the ID's of the tweets. 
        </p>
        <p>   
            We found two sources that containing open tweet-id's related to our project, and another source that stored the full length of the tweets made by Donald Trump. The three sources are listed below:
        </p>
        <b> 115th U.S. Congress Tweet Ids </b> <br>
        <p>
          A open dataset with 2,041,399 tweets from the Twitter accounts of members of the 115th U.S. Congress collected in the period of January 27, 2017 and January 2, 2019. The dataset consists of two files of interest -  namely
          <ul>
              <li>senators-1.txt: that contains tweet ids for Seneators</li>
              <li>representatives-1.txt: that contains tweet ids for Representatives</li>
          </ul>
          <i>Littman, Justin, 2017, "115th U.S. Congress Tweet Ids, <a href='https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/UIVHQR'>https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/UIVHQR</a>, Harvard Dataverse, V5.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> 116th U.S. Congress Tweet Ids </b> <br>
          A open dataset with 2,817,747 tweets from the Twitter accounts of members of the 116th U.S. Congress collected in the period of January 27, 2019 and May 7, 2020.  The dataset consists of two files of interest - namely
          <ul>
              <li> Senators: congress116-senate-ids.txt` that contains tweet ids for Seneatorss</li>
              <li>Representatives: congress116-house-ids.txt` that contains tweet ids for Representatives</li>
          </ul>
          <i>Wrubel, Laura; Kerchner, Daniel, 2020, "116th U.S. Congress Tweet Ids, <a href='https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MBOJNS'>https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MBOJNS</a>, Harvard Dataverse, V5.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Trump Twitter Archive </b> <br>
          A site dedicated to scrape every single tweet from Donald J. Trump. Here we downloaded all tweets in the periods of January 27, 2017 and January 2, 2019 and January 27, 2019 and May 7, 2020.
          See more at <a href='https://www.thetrumparchive.com/'> Trump Twitter Archive </a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b> Twitter Handle Data </b> <br>
          Examing the Harvard Dataverse we discovered that polticians in congress can have number of profiles for instance a private profile, a profile associated with work in congress and campaign profile.
          Unfortunally the data also contains a large number of random profiles.
          Furthermore, the Harvard data did not list which party the account where associated with.
          To combat this we found a list of congress memebers with their party association, whether they act as Senator or Represenative and, most important for the project, their twitter profile (if they have an account the vast majority has).
          That meant rather than dealing with multiple accounts for the same congress member or including random multiple accounts we would only consider one account per congress member.
          We used the following two different sources for the 115 and 116 congress for this.
          <ul>
            <li><b>115 Congress twitter info </b>: (PDF) <a class="link" href="https://www.sciencecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/115th-Congress-Twitter-Handles.pdf">https://www.sciencecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/115th-Congress-Twitter-Handles.pdf</a></li>
            <li><b>116 Congress twitter info</b>: (Website) <a class="link" href="https://triagecancer.org/congressional-social-media">https://triagecancer.org/congressional-social-media</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
          The information was scraped from the PDF and HTML site using a set of Python libraries. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <b> Media Data </b> <br>
          We have not been able to find consist sources that list publishes twitter id for all tweet the American News Media in the period January 27, 2017 to January 2, 2019 and  January 27, 2019 and May 7, 2020. 
          However, we have manually found 16 prominent American News Media and their respective Twitter account names.
          This will be ultized to check if a polticians have retweetet a tweet that was orginally posted by a media account.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-5">How to Recreate Data</h3>
        <p>
          As we per Twitter's Terms of Service can't distribute full length tweets we naturally can't share the data we have performed our analysis on.
          However, we have created a Jupyter-Notebook that elaborates on how the data set can be recreated in details. 
          The notebook also elaborates how the Twitter Handle Data was scraped from the PDF and the website.
          The notebook can found in our GitHub repository with name <tt>Exstract_And_Clean_data.ipynb</tt> or be viewed online by clicking the Jupyter logo below.

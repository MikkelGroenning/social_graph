        <p>
            The precidency of Donald J. Trump began at noon EST (17:00 UTC) on January 20, 2017 when he was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, and will com to an end the on January 20, 2021 as he ultimately lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden. It is not far fetched to say it has been bizare precidency compared to the most recent precidencies. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It feels like America has been splitted in two the suporters of Trump and those agianst him - Repulicans agianst Democrats. In this project we wanted to explore if our hypothesis of polarization can be seen or rejected by analyzing the Congress of United States behavoir on the social media Twitter including the infamous Twitter account manged by Donald J. Trump. The idea was to analyze the congress tweets from the time of the 45th precidency to explore potential polarization.

            With access to the Twitter API it is only possible to exctract the most reason 3200 tweets from a given account (3200 tweet do not go far back for many american polticians). However, Twitter's Terms of Service do allow for datasets of tweets ID's to be distributed to third parties (not the full JSON). Luckily we found two sources that keep tweet id open very related to our project and one sources that stored the full length tweets of Donald Trump namely:
